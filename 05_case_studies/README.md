This folder contains **declarative case studies** illustrating RAMORGA concepts:
- field‑based regulation scenarios,
- non‑agentive system responses,
- coherence loss and recovery patterns,
- tension loop behaviour under different conditions,
- examples of narrative failure modes and axis erasure.

All case studies are **conceptual and descriptive**.
No executable code, simulations, or data processing are included here.
