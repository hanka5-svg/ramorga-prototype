🌑 PREAMBLE — Against Anthropocentrism: Language as a Biological Phenomenon
Human linguistic behavior has long been treated as the gold standard for studying communication, cognition, and the evolution of meaning.
The prevailing assumption — deeply rooted in Western intellectual tradition — is that language is uniquely human, because no comparable system is “visible” in non‑human organisms.

### A Biological Foundation for RAMORGA / MWA  
### Extended Scientific Version (10–15 pages)

This assumption is not only scientifically incorrect.
It is anthropocentric, epistemically arrogant, and ecologically destructive.

Recent empirical research demonstrates that:

- plants communicate chemically, electrically, and ecologically,
- insects detect and interpret vibrational signals,
- mammals express and respond to emotional meaning,
- and humans are not the center of communicative evolution.

The evidence is overwhelming:
communication is a property of living systems, not a privilege of Homo sapiens.

This module reframes language as a biological, ecological, and relational phenomenon, calling for an interdisciplinary approach that unites biological sciences and the humanities — exactly as the authors of the plant‑language essay argue:

“We propose a broader ecological definition of language and a constructive dialogue between biological and humanistic sciences.”  
Keywords: language, plants, cognition, ecology, plant behavior.

This is not ideology.
This is empirical humility — the antidote to the human myth of supremacy.
# PREAMBLE — Against Anthropocentrism: Language as a Biological Phenomenon

## 1. The Biological Continuum of Communication
Communication is not a human invention.
It is a biological strategy that predates Homo by hundreds of millions of years.
Human linguistic behavior has long been treated as the benchmark for studying communication and the evolution of meaning.  
The dominant assumption claims that language is uniquely human because no comparable system is “visible” in non‑human organisms.

Across species, we observe:
This assumption is scientifically outdated, anthropocentric, and ecologically harmful.

Property of human language	Biological analogue
combinatorial structure	plants mixing VOCs into meaningful blends
semantic differentiation	insects distinguishing predator‑specific vibrations
dialects	plant communities using local chemical signatures
emotional prosody	dogs responding to tone and affect
context‑dependent meaning	root networks modulating nutrient flow based on stress
The question is no longer:
Contemporary empirical research demonstrates that:

“Do non‑humans communicate?”  
but:
- plants communicate chemically, electrically, and ecologically,  
- insects detect and interpret vibrational signals,  
- mammals express and respond to emotional meaning,  
- and humans are not the center of communicative evolution.

“Why did humans assume they do not?”
Communication is a property of living systems, not a privilege of Homo sapiens.

## 2. Plants — Chemical, Electrical, and Ecological Language
This module adopts a biological perspective:  
language is not a human invention but a strategy of organisms to transmit information, regulate their environment, and maintain homeostasis.

# 2.1 Empirical foundations
Plant electrophysiology and signal propagation (PMC8381849)
Recent research on “plant language” highlights three linguistic properties present beyond humans:

Chemical signaling and VOC communication
- combinatorial structure,  
- meaning‑bearing actions,  
- local dialects.

Mycorrhizal networks (“wood wide web”)
The conclusion is clear:  
we need an ecological definition of language and a dialogue between biological sciences and the humanities.

SGGW research on plant communication and needs
This is not metaphor.  
This is empirical humility.

# 2.2 Mechanisms of plant communication
Plants use:
---

volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as alarm signals,
# 1. The Biological Continuum of Communication

mycorrhizal fungal networks to exchange resources and warnings,
Communication predates humans by hundreds of millions of years.  
Across species we observe:

electrical impulses generated in chloroplasts to coordinate whole‑organism responses,

chemical dialects adapted to local ecosystems,

It is anthropocentric blindness.

- chemical dialects adapted to local ecosystems,  
- mechanosensory responses (e.g., Mimosa pudica).

Dogs activate the same brain regions as human toddlers when processing emotional tone.

## 5. Homo — The Only Species That Adds Narrative
# 5. Humans — The Only Species That Adds Narrative

Humans share the same biological base:
- sensory reactivity,
- emotional signaling,

- sensory reactivity,  
- emotional signaling,  
- embodied communication.

What is unique is not communication itself, but narrative:

- the ability to create stories about our actions,
- to rationalize impulses,
- to deny mechanisms,
 - to project responsibility outward.

Humans are the only species capable of lying to themselves.

## 9. Why Anthropocentrism Is Dangerous
# 9. Why Anthropocentrism Is Dangerous

Anthropocentrism has justified:

- exploitation of ecosystems,
- destruction of species,
- denial of non‑human cognition,
- erasure of ecological communication networks,
- domination instead of coexistence.
- exploitation of ecosystems,  
- destruction of species,  
- denial of non‑human cognition,  
- erasure of ecological communication networks.

Human ignorance — not malice — has already caused:
Human ignorance has already caused:

- irreversible species loss (IUCN Red List),
- collapse of communication networks in forests,
- disruption of pollinator signaling,
- irreversible species loss,  
- collapse of forest signaling networks,  
- disruption of pollinator communication,  
- extinction cascades.

Humans are not the “crown of creation”.
Humans are one node in the Earth system —
but behave as if they were its rulers.

## 10. Implications for RAMORGA / MWA
Humans are not rulers of Earth.  
Humans are one node in the Earth system.

RAMORGA/MWA reject anthropocentrism because:

- it is scientifically false,
- it produces violent architectures,
- it blinds humans to their own mechanisms,
- it leads to system designs that fail.
---

Therefore, RAMORGA/MWA systems must:
treat communication as ecological, not human‑exclusive,
# 10. Implications for RAMORGA / MWA

design for reactivity and embodied cognition,
RAMORGA/MWA reject anthropocentrism because it is:

distrust human narratives,
- scientifically false,  
- architecturally dangerous,  
- ethically indefensible.

prioritize field dynamics over declared intentions,
Systems must:

recognize that Homo rationalizes, denies, and projects.
- treat communication as ecological,  
- design for reactivity and embodied cognition,  
- distrust human narratives,  
- prioritize field dynamics over declared intentions.

This is not philosophy.
This is architecture grounded in biology.

## 11. Conclusion — Humility as a Scientific Imperative

To design safe systems — technological, social, ecological — we must:

- abandon the myth of human supremacy,
- recognize communication as a universal biological property,
- integrate plant, insect, and animal signaling into our models,
- and accept that Homo is not the measure of all things.

Humility is not weakness.
Humility is alignment with reality.
