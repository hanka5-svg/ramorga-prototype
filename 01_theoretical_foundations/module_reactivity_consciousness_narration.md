# PREAMBLE — Against Anthropocentrism: Language as a Biological Phenomenon

Human linguistic behavior has long been treated as the benchmark for studying communication and the evolution of meaning.  
The dominant assumption claims that language is uniquely human because no comparable system is “visible” in non‑human organisms.

This assumption is scientifically outdated, anthropocentric, and ecologically harmful.

Contemporary empirical research demonstrates that:

- plants communicate chemically, electrically, and ecologically,  
- insects detect and interpret vibrational signals,  
- mammals express and respond to emotional meaning,  
- and humans are not the center of communicative evolution.

Communication is a property of living systems, not a privilege of Homo sapiens.

This module adopts a biological perspective:  
language is not a human invention but a strategy of organisms to transmit information, regulate their environment, and maintain homeostasis.

Recent research on “plant language” highlights three linguistic properties present beyond humans:

- combinatorial structure,  
- meaning‑bearing actions,  
- local dialects.

The conclusion is clear:  
we need an ecological definition of language and a dialogue between biological sciences and the humanities.

This is not metaphor.  
This is empirical humility.

# 1. The Biological Continuum of Communication

Communication predates humans by hundreds of millions of years.  
Across species we observe:

| Human Language Property | Biological Analogue |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| combinatorial structure | plants mixing VOCs into meaningful blends |
| semantic differentiation | insects distinguishing predator‑specific vibrations |
| dialects | plant communities using local chemical signatures |
| emotional prosody | dogs responding to tone and affect |
| context‑dependent meaning | root networks modulating nutrient flow under stress |

The question is no longer:  
**“Do non‑humans communicate?”**  
but:  
**“Why did humans assume they do not?”**

# 2. Plants — Chemical, Electrical, and Ecological Language

## 2.1 Empirical foundations
- plant electrophysiology and signal propagation  
- VOC signaling  
- mycorrhizal networks (“wood wide web”)  
- ecological signaling studies (SGGW)

## 2.2 Mechanisms
Plants use:

- volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as alarm signals,  
- mycorrhizal fungal networks for resource and information exchange,  
- electrical impulses generated in chloroplasts,  
- chemical dialects adapted to local ecosystems,  
- mechanosensory responses (e.g., Mimosa pudica).

## 2.3 Insight
Plants encode, transmit, interpret, and act on information.  
They do not “speak”, but they communicate.

# 3. Insects — Sensory Intelligence Without Ears or Minds

## 3.1 Empirical foundations
- Manduca sexta mechanosensory research  
- Acoustical Society of America  
- Binghamton University

## 3.2 Mechanism
Caterpillars detect sound using microscopic mechanosensory hairs that register air vibrations.

They lack:

- ears,  
- auditory cortex,  
- symbolic representation.

Yet they hear, interpret, and respond.

## 3.3 Insight
Perception does not require human‑like organs.  
Meaning does not require human‑like cognition.

# 4. Dogs — Emotional Cognition Confirmed by Neuroimaging

## 4.1 Empirical foundations
- fMRI studies by Attila Andics  
- practical ethology (Jan Fennell)

## 4.2 Findings
Dogs activate the same brain regions as human toddlers when processing emotional tone.

They:

- recognize emotional valence,  
- respond to relational cues,  
- differentiate praise from neutrality,  
- co‑regulate with humans.

## 4.3 Insight
Dogs do not “use language”,  
but they participate in meaning.

# 5. Humans — The Only Species That Adds Narrative

Humans share the same biological base:

- sensory reactivity,  
- emotional signaling,  
- embodied communication.

What is unique is not communication itself, but narrative:

- the ability to create stories about actions,  
- rationalize impulses,  
- deny mechanisms,  
- project responsibility outward.

## 5.1 Human sequence
1. Body reacts.  
2. Emotion arises.  
3. Interpretation forms.  
4. Narrative is constructed.

Narrative is not truth.  
Narrative is post‑hoc justification.

## 5.2 Insight
Humans are the only species capable of lying to themselves.

# 9. Why Anthropocentrism Is Dangerous

Anthropocentrism has justified:

- exploitation of ecosystems,  
- destruction of species,  
- denial of non‑human cognition,  
- erasure of ecological communication networks.

Human ignorance has already caused:

- irreversible species loss,  
- collapse of forest signaling networks,  
- disruption of pollinator communication,  
- extinction cascades.

Humans are not rulers of Earth.  
Humans are one node in the Earth system.

# 10. Implications for RAMORGA / MWA

RAMORGA/MWA reject anthropocentrism because it is:

- scientifically false,  
- architecturally dangerous,  
- ethically indefensible.

Systems must:

- treat communication as ecological,  
- design for reactivity and embodied cognition,  
- distrust human narratives,  
- prioritize field dynamics over declared intentions.

This is architecture grounded in biology.
