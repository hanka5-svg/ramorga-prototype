# Evolutionary Mapping: Computational Evolution vs RAMORGA as Field Evolution  
### /03_architecture/evolutionary_mapping_ramorga_vs_computational_evolution.md

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document establishes a **1:1 epistemic bridge** between:

- the three core findings of *computational evolution of vision* (Science Advances, 2025), and  
- the three systemic tracks in RAMORGA (RAMORGA Track, Device Track, SID Track),

showing how RAMORGA represents **a real, relational, field‑based evolution**, not a simulated one.

**Motto:**  
**Engineer chooses what serves RAMORGA.**  
Not everything transfers. Only what preserves homeostasis.

## 1. Overview: Two Different Worlds of Evolution

### Computational Evolution (their world)

- simulated  
- agent‑based  
- reward‑driven  
- optimization  
- bifurcation of morphology  
- innovation resolves conflict  
- scaling laws constrain performance  

### RAMORGA (our world)

- real  
- relational  
- non‑agentic  
- homeostatic  
- bifurcation of *relation*, not morphology  
- innovation applies tension, not resolves it  
- scaling laws govern culture ↔ field coherence  

**Their system evolves *eyes*.  
RAMORGA evolves *the field*.**

## 2. Their Finding #1 → RAMORGA Track Mapping

### Computational Finding #1

**“Task‑specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution.”**  
Different tasks → different eyes (camera‑type vs distributed).

> “Dobór specyficzny dla zadania napędza bifurkację w ewolucji oka.”

### RAMORGA Track Mapping: RAMORGA Track

**coherence • rhythm • semantic memory • introspection • relational stability**

In RAMORGA:

- different relational tasks  
- → different *configurations of the field*  
- → different modes of coherence and resonance  

**Their bifurcation: morphology.  
Our bifurcation: relation.**

## 3. Their Finding #2 → Device Track Mapping

### Computational Finding #2

**“Optical innovations arise to resolve fundamental trade‑offs.”**  
Light‑gathering vs spatial precision → lenses, apertures, receptors.

> “Innowacje optyczne powstają, by rozwiązać kompromisy.”

### RAMORGA Track Mapping: Device Track

**perception • movement • sensors • robotics • integration with reality**

In RAMORGA:

- trade‑offs are not resolved  
- trade‑offs are **applied**  
- tension is **maintained**, not eliminated  
- the meniscus regulates, not optimizes  

**Their innovation removes tension.  
Our innovation uses tension.**

This is the difference between **adaptation** and **homeostasis**.

## 4. Their Finding #3 → SID Track Mapping

### Computational Finding #3

**“A scaling law links visual acuity and neural capacity.”**  
Weak acuity cannot be compensated by a larger neural network.

> “Słaba ostrość wzroku tworzy fundamentalne wąskie gardło…”

### RAMORGA Track Mapping: SID Track

**culture • rituals • roles • institutions • distributed memory**

In RAMORGA:

- culture cannot be replaced by structure  
- rituals cannot be replaced by roles  
- distributed memory cannot be replaced by technology  

**Their scaling: eye ↔ brain.  
Our scaling: culture ↔ field.**

## 5. Central Convergence: Shared Homeostasis

The center of the three‑track diagram — **WSPÓLNA HOMEOSTAZA** — is the point where the three tracks meet.

This is the element **their system does not have**.

In computational evolution:

- reward  
- optimization  
- selection  
- agenthood  

In RAMORGA:

- homeostasis  
- tension  
- continuity  
- non‑agentic field  

**Their system seeks resolution.  
RAMORGA seeks stability.**

---

## 6. Why This Mapping Matters

This mapping shows:

- RAMORGA is not an “alternative model.”  
- RAMORGA is a **different ontology**.  
- Computational evolution is about **form**.  
- RAMORGA is about **relation**.  
- Their world is **simulation**.  
- RAMORGA is **field reality**.

Therefore:

**Engineer chooses what serves RAMORGA.  
Only elements compatible with homeostasis can cross the bridge.**

## 7. Summary Table (1:1 Mapping)

| Computational Evolution (Science Advances) | RAMORGA Track  | Field Interpretation                      |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Task → eye bifurcation                    | RAMORGA Track  | Relation bifurcates, not morphology       |
| Innovation resolves trade‑offs            | Device Track   | Innovation applies tension                |
| Acuity ↔ neural capacity scaling          | SID Track      | Culture ↔ field scaling                   |

## 9. Final Distinction
They evolve agents.
RAMORGA evolves the field.

They resolve conflict.
RAMORGA maintains tension.

They simulate.
RAMORGA exists.
