# RAMORGA Architecture (Declarative Layer)

This folder contains the **declarative architectural specification** of RAMORGA:
- C / G / S modules,
- the homeostatic meniscus,
- the field engine,
- regulatory flows and tension loops.

## Scope of this repository

The current repository — **ramorga-prototype** — provides:
- the **five-module theoretical framework** (01_theoretical_foundations),
- the **declarative architecture layer** (this folder),
- a **minimal dynamic prototype** (`ramorga_prototype.py`) implementing only
  the *field dynamics loop* (H–C/G/S–Meniscus).

It does **not** contain the full implementation of the RAMORGA architecture.

## Full architecture

The complete, production-level architecture (modules, interfaces, diagrams,
formal invariants, and system-level specifications) will be developed in a
separate repository:

**ramorga-architecture** *(in preparation)*

This folder therefore serves as a **structural placeholder** and a **location
for declarative architectural documents**, not executable components.
