# RAMORGA Architecture (Placeholder)

This folder will contain the architectural specification of RAMORGA
(C/G/S modules, homeostatic meniscus, field engine, and regulatory flows).

The current repository — *ramorga-prototype* — provides only the
theoretical foundations (five-module framework).

The full architecture will be developed in a separate repository:
**ramorga-architecture** (in preparation).

No architectural components are implemented here yet.
