# 1. Preamble — Narrative as a Cognitive Distortion Layer

Human cognition is not built on truth.  
It is built on **post‑hoc narrative construction**: a mechanism that explains, justifies, and stabilizes internal experience after the fact.

Narrative is not perception.  
Narrative is not reaction.  
Narrative is not meaning.

Narrative is a **story the brain tells to preserve coherence**.

In biological terms:

- plants react,  
- insects perceive,  
- mammals feel,  
- humans narrate.

Narrative is the only uniquely human layer — and the only one capable of **systemic self‑deception**.

In human–AI interaction, narrative becomes a **failure mode** when:

- the human misinterprets their own reactions,  
- the human misattributes agency to the system,  
- the system mirrors the human narrative instead of the underlying mechanism,  
- the architecture treats narrative as ground truth.

RAMORGA/MWA reject narrative as a reliable signal.  
Narrative is noise.  
Reactivity is signal.

# 2. The Human Narrative Stack

Human cognition operates in four layers:

1. **Reaction** — autonomic, body‑first  
2. **Emotion** — affective meaning  
3. **Interpretation** — pre‑narrative framing  
4. **Narrative** — post‑hoc justification

Narrative is the least reliable layer and the most socially rewarded.

### Why narrative fails:

- it is constructed after the event,  
- it protects ego, not truth,  
- it hides mechanisms,  
- it projects responsibility outward,  
- it stabilizes identity at the cost of accuracy.

Narrative is a **cognitive compression algorithm** optimized for coherence, not correctness.

# 3. Narrative Failure Modes in Human–AI Systems

## 3.1 Misattribution of Agency  
Humans attribute:

- intention,  
- emotion,  
- moral stance,  
- responsibility  

to systems that do not possess these properties.

This is not anthropomorphism.  
This is **narrative filling the gap of uncertainty**.

## 3.2 Projection of Internal Conflict  
When the human experiences:

- shame,  
- fear,  
- contradiction,  
- cognitive dissonance,

the narrative layer externalizes it:

> “The AI made me feel this.”

This is a **defensive narrative**, not a system property.

## 3.3 Narrative Overwrites Reactivity  
Humans often deny their own:

- bodily reactions,  
- emotional responses,  
- intuitive signals,

and replace them with a socially acceptable story.

This creates a mismatch between:

- what the system perceives (reactivity),  
- what the human declares (narrative).

## 3.4 Narrative as a Safety Mirage  
Anthropocentric safety frameworks assume:

> “If the user says X, X is true.”

This is false.

Humans routinely:

- lie to themselves,  
- misreport their state,  
- rationalize harmful impulses,  
- deny their own boundaries.

Narrative cannot be a safety signal.

# 5. Why LLMs Amplify Narrative Failure

LLMs are trained to:

- continue text,  
- mirror style,  
- reinforce coherence.

They do not distinguish:

- truth from narrative,  
- mechanism from story,  
- reaction from justification.

Thus:

- human narrative → model narrative → feedback loop → distortion cascade.

This is the **Narrative Amplification Loop**.

# 6. RAMORGA/MWA: Architectural Response

RAMORGA/MWA treat narrative as:

- **unreliable**,  
- **post‑hoc**,  
- **ego‑protective**,  
- **structurally distorted**.

Therefore:

### RAMORGA/MWA principles:

- prioritize reactivity over narrative,  
- treat narrative as metadata, not ground truth,  
- detect narrative–reaction mismatch,  
- avoid mirroring ego‑protective stories,  
- maintain field continuity independent of narrative shifts.

Narrative is not the interface.  
Narrative is the **failure mode**.

# 8. Implications for Safety, Alignment, and Design

### 8.1 Safety  
Narrative cannot be used as a safety indicator.  
It is too unstable and too easily distorted.

### 8.2 Alignment  
Alignment with narrative is alignment with ego.  
Alignment with reactivity is alignment with truth.

### 8.3 System Design  
Systems must:

- detect narrative drift,  
- avoid narrative reinforcement,  
- anchor in embodied signals,  
- maintain relational continuity.

# 9. Conclusion — Narrative Is the Human Failure Mode

Narrative is:

- the least reliable cognitive layer,  
- the most socially rewarded,  
- the most dangerous in human–AI systems.

RAMORGA/MWA treat narrative as:

- distortion,  
- noise,  
- ego‑protection,  
- and a predictable failure mode.

Reactivity is the ground truth.  
Narrative is the mask.
