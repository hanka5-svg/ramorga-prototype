# 02_biological_evidence

This folder contains the **declarative biological grounding** for RAMORGA:
- analogues of field dynamics in biological systems,
- homeostatic regulation patterns,
- multi‑module coordination without agentive control,
- systemic responses to tension, overload, and coherence loss.

This is a **conceptual documentation layer**.
No biological modelling, simulation, or empirical data processing is implemented here.
