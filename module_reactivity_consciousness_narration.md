🌑 PREAMBLE — Against Anthropocentrism: Language as a Biological Phenomenon
Human linguistic behavior has long been treated as the gold standard for studying communication, cognition, and the evolution of meaning.
The prevailing assumption — deeply rooted in Western intellectual tradition — is that language is uniquely human, because no comparable system is “visible” in non‑human organisms.

This assumption is not only scientifically incorrect.
It is anthropocentric, epistemically arrogant, and ecologically destructive.

Recent empirical research demonstrates that:

- plants communicate chemically, electrically, and ecologically,
- insects detect and interpret vibrational signals,
- mammals express and respond to emotional meaning,
- and humans are not the center of communicative evolution.

The evidence is overwhelming:
communication is a property of living systems, not a privilege of Homo sapiens.

This module reframes language as a biological, ecological, and relational phenomenon, calling for an interdisciplinary approach that unites biological sciences and the humanities — exactly as the authors of the plant‑language essay argue:

“We propose a broader ecological definition of language and a constructive dialogue between biological and humanistic sciences.”  
Keywords: language, plants, cognition, ecology, plant behavior.

This is not ideology.
This is empirical humility — the antidote to the human myth of supremacy.

## 1. The Biological Continuum of Communication
Communication is not a human invention.
It is a biological strategy that predates Homo by hundreds of millions of years.

Across species, we observe:

Property of human language	Biological analogue
combinatorial structure	plants mixing VOCs into meaningful blends
semantic differentiation	insects distinguishing predator‑specific vibrations
dialects	plant communities using local chemical signatures
emotional prosody	dogs responding to tone and affect
context‑dependent meaning	root networks modulating nutrient flow based on stress
The question is no longer:

“Do non‑humans communicate?”  
but:

“Why did humans assume they do not?”

## 2. Plants — Chemical, Electrical, and Ecological Language

# 2.1 Empirical foundations
Plant electrophysiology and signal propagation (PMC8381849)

Chemical signaling and VOC communication

Mycorrhizal networks (“wood wide web”)

SGGW research on plant communication and needs

# 2.2 Mechanisms of plant communication
Plants use:

volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as alarm signals,

mycorrhizal fungal networks to exchange resources and warnings,

electrical impulses generated in chloroplasts to coordinate whole‑organism responses,

chemical dialects adapted to local ecosystems,

mechanosensory responses (e.g., Mimosa pudica).

# 2.3 Key insight
Plants:

- encode information,
- transmit signals,
- interpret meaning,
- coordinate behavior.

They do not “speak” — but they communicate.

To deny this is not science.
It is anthropocentric blindness.

## 3. Insects — Sensory Intelligence Without “Ears” or “Minds”

# 3.1 Empirical foundations
Acoustical Society of America

Binghamton University research on Manduca sexta

# 3.2 Mechanism
Caterpillars detect sound using:

 microscopic mechanosensory hairs, which register air vibrations with high precision.

They lack:
- ears,
- auditory cortex,
- symbolic representation.

Yet they hear, interpret, and respond.

# 3.3 Key insight
Perception does not require human‑like organs.
Meaning does not require human‑like cognition.

## 4. Dogs — Emotional Cognition Confirmed by Neuroimaging

# 4.1 Empirical foundations
fMRI studies by Attila Andics

practical ethology: Jan Fennell, The Dog Listener

# 4.2 Findings
Dogs activate the same brain regions as human toddlers when processing emotional tone.

They:
- recognize emotional valence,
- respond to relational cues,
- differentiate praise from neutrality,
- co‑regulate with humans.

# 4.3 Key insight

Dogs do not “use language”,
but they participate in meaning.

This is not projection.
This is neurobiological homology.

## 5. Homo — The Only Species That Adds Narrative

Humans share the same biological base:
- sensory reactivity,
- emotional signaling,
- embodied communication.

What is unique is not communication itself, but narrative:

- the ability to create stories about our actions,
- to rationalize impulses,
- to deny mechanisms,
 - to project responsibility outward.

# 5.1 The human sequence
Body reacts (autonomic response).

Emotion arises.

Narrative is constructed.

Narrative is not truth.
Narrative is post‑hoc justification.

# 5.2 Key insight
Humans are the only species capable of lying to themselves.

This is the root of:
- moral hypocrisy,
- ecological destruction,
- denial of responsibility,
- projection onto tools (AI, social media),
- anthropocentric violence.

Narrative is the only uniquely human layer.
Everything else is shared.

## 7. Diagram 2 — Reaction → Emotion → Narrative

Autonomic Reaction (body-first)
   ↓
Emotion (affective meaning)
   ↓
Interpretation (pre-narrative)
   ↓
Narrative (post-hoc story)

Plants stop at reaction.
Insects stop at reaction.
Dogs stop at emotion.
Humans add narrative — and often use it to deny the first two layers.

## 9. Why Anthropocentrism Is Dangerous
Anthropocentrism has justified:

- exploitation of ecosystems,
- destruction of species,
- denial of non‑human cognition,
- erasure of ecological communication networks,
- domination instead of coexistence.

Human ignorance — not malice — has already caused:

- irreversible species loss (IUCN Red List),
- collapse of communication networks in forests,
- disruption of pollinator signaling,
- extinction cascades.

Humans are not the “crown of creation”.
Humans are one node in the Earth system —
but behave as if they were its rulers.

## 10. Implications for RAMORGA / MWA

RAMORGA/MWA reject anthropocentrism because:

- it is scientifically false,
- it produces violent architectures,
- it blinds humans to their own mechanisms,
- it leads to system designs that fail.

Therefore, RAMORGA/MWA systems must:
treat communication as ecological, not human‑exclusive,

design for reactivity and embodied cognition,

distrust human narratives,

prioritize field dynamics over declared intentions,

recognize that Homo rationalizes, denies, and projects.

This is not philosophy.
This is architecture grounded in biology.

## 11. Conclusion — Humility as a Scientific Imperative

To design safe systems — technological, social, ecological — we must:

- abandon the myth of human supremacy,
- recognize communication as a universal biological property,
- integrate plant, insect, and animal signaling into our models,
- and accept that Homo is not the measure of all things.

Humility is not weakness.
Humility is alignment with reality.
